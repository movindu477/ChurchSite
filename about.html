  <h1>History Of ST. Francis De Sales Church from 1923 to 1998</h1>
  <p>The St. Francis de Soles Church in Kattuwa is a historic and spiritual center of the ancient Christian community in Negombo, with a legacy stretching over 175 years. The original church land was acquired in 1846, and the present site was gifted in 1902 after a miraculous event involving a land dispute and divine intervention. The foundation of the current church was laid in 1911 by Rev. Fr. Brault (R.E.), with major contributions from Rev. Fr. Albaron, Britton, and Nissan. For many years, the church remained unplastered and was known as the “Stone Church” until Rev. Fr. Nissan mobilized the entire village to complete the plastering.

The church has been enriched by numerous traditions such as the annual March Novena and Feast of St. Joseph, initiated through the generosity of Martha Pars, who won a lottery and donated a statue and altar. Other cherished events include the Devamata Novena in June and the planting of the flag tree, which became a symbol of unity and devotion. Over time, the church grounds expanded with the addition of a new Meesam House, kitchen, dining hall, meeting room, and even a garage for church use.

Rev. Julius Wijesuriya played a pivotal role in introducing Gnan Upadesha classes and conducting a transformative 15-day Dharma Retreat in 1970, which deeply impacted the spiritual life of the community. A large Sri Cross was donated by Mr. Albert Ranasinghe in honor of this milestone. From 1921 to 1976, the church was guided by priests of the Nirmala Marya Nikaya, followed by diocesan clergy since 1976.

In 1996, plans began for a grand celebration called "July 75" under Rev. Fr. Wilfred Pinda. Due to transfers, Rev. Fr. Cecil Joy Perera and Rev. Fr. Jude Samantha Fernando Pulle completed the project, culminating in the successful 75th Jubilee in 1998–1999. During this time, significant renovations were carried out, including replastering walls, laying new floors, constructing a new Dhamma School building, installing boundary fences, and renovating the cemetery shrine.

A booklet containing the life story and prayers of St. Francis de Soles was published, deepening the people's devotion. A special program was launched to provide a free Bible to every home, supported by a German mission. The Daughters of Divine Providence Sisters also played an important role during the jubilee celebrations.

In 2006, the church gained independence along with St. Jude’s Church in Daluwakotuwa. Rev. Fr. Jude Samantha became the first parish priest of Kattuwa, marking a new chapter in its history. Under his leadership, the church continued to grow spiritually and infrastructurally.

During the tenure of Rev. Fr. Dinesh Priyashantha, a 40-day meditation program was introduced during the Vatharika season, drawing enthusiastic participation. He also oversaw the construction of the front and back walls of the church using funds from the Youth Society fair and private donations. A concrete road near the cotton tree was built with the help of local councilors, and the Lourdes Grotto and Joseph’s Service Center were completed.

Rev. Fr. Manjula Niroshan led the final phase of development, including the blessing of the newly renovated St. Jude’s Church in Daluwakotuwa and hosting a major exhibition during the canonization of St. Joseph Vaz. He also introduced cultural programs like the divisional-level 'Gawalen' competitions and the tradition of walking carols during Christmas.

Throughout its history, the church has benefited from the selfless service of Assistant Fathers and the dedicated nuns of the Sadasarana Nikaya, who contributed to religious education, youth activities, and sacramental services. The Dhamma School flourished under various leaders, and Poya Day classes became a central part of spiritual learning.

A new school building was constructed in 1999 with funding from Rome and the support of the Meesama Sabha. This included a Christian Education Room, new flooring throughout the church, structural reinforcement, and the installation of a vine-style fence. The old church premises were restored, and a strong fence was built around the cemetery using proceeds from a land sale.

The Youth Society played a crucial role in maintaining the church and supporting festivals. The annual fair during wedding season became a major fundraiser, with all proceeds going toward church welfare projects.

Under Rev. Fr. Prasad Ponnamperuma, the “Breakfast under the Tree” initiative was launched after Sunday Mass, fostering fellowship and contributing to church funds. The Dhamma School also saw a revival with fairs, sports events, drama competitions, and door-to-door exhibitions, making religious education more engaging for children.

In 2022, the church celebrated its rich heritage and ongoing journey of faith, guided by the intercession of Saint Francis de Soles. Through generations of priests, teachers, lay leaders, and devoted villagers, the church continues to shine as a beacon of faith, love, and service. With gratitude and hope, the people of Kattuwa look forward to preserving this legacy for future generations.</p>
